                                            In case of unusual circumstances such as situations where more than one holder have access to an account, the Customer, may for any reason find that he/she is able, through the Service, to access or transact with any Account which is not pertaining to him/her (the Linked Account), the Customer undertakes to immediately stop using the Service and cease inquiring on or doing any transaction on the Linked Account and inform the Bank in strict confidence. The Customer shall be liable for any transactions done by him on the Linked Account and shall solely assume full liability for any claim against the Bank, damage or loss, financial or otherwise, suffered by the Bank or any other person as a result of the Customer’s unauthorized access to and/or use of the information contained in the Linked Account. The Customer further undertakes to indemnify and hold the Bank harmless against and from any such claim, damage or loss and agrees that under circumstances where the Linked Account becomes accessible to him for any reason, the Bank may temporarily disable the Customer’s access to the Service, until corrective action as the Bank may deem necessary is completed.

It is a condition of allowing the Customer to download from the Site that any liability on NBB’s part in respect of or arising directly or indirectly from, any virus or other damaging code or program, or howsoever caused, is excluded to the extent permitted by law. Therefore, the Customer should run up-to-date virus checking software as soon as he downloads any materials or before installing any software.

NBB reserves the right to block or suspend the Customer’s access to the Service if there is any failure or error in relation to the use of his Customer Security Codes, or for any other reason at NBB’s discretion. In making an assessment of cases of repeated entry failure, NBB reserves the right to take into account any recent failed attempts to access the Customer’s Account. NBB will normally block access in the event of three consecutive Security Codes entry errors. The number of consecutive Security Code errors allowed before access is blocked can be changed by NBB at its sole discretion. If access to the Service is blocked for any reason, an appropriate message will be displayed for the Customer’s information when he tries to log in. In the event that access to the Service is blocked, the Customer might be required to present himself in person to NBB whereupon NBB will verify his identity and determine, in NBB’s absolute discretion, whether his access to the Service shall be unblocked.
